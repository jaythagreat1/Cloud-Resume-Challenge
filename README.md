## Cloud Resume Challenge (AWS Track)

Welcome to my Cloud Resume Challenge repository! This challenge is designed for individuals who are interested in kickstarting their career in the cloud. It consists of 16 steps, grouped into 5 different chunks, and offers the flexibility to choose from three major cloud service providers: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Amazon Web Services (AWS). For this particular challenge, I have chosen the AWS track.

To successfully complete the Cloud Resume Challenge (CRC), all 16 steps must be accomplished in their entirety. Here is an overview of the steps involved:

1. Certification
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Static Website
5. HTTPS
6. DNS
7. Javascript
8. Database
9. API
10. Python
11. Tests
12. Infrastructure as Code
13. Source control
14. CI/CD (Front End)
15. CI/CD (Back End)
16. Blog

Within this repository, you will find my progress and work towards completing the CRC using AWS. The Cloud Resume Challenge is an excellent opportunity to develop essential skills for pursuing a career in Cloud technologies. It was originally created by Forrest Brazeal.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I hope you find my journey through the Cloud Resume Challenge insightful and informative!

## Services Used

Throughout my Cloud Resume Challenge journey, I utilized a variety of AWS services and tools to complete the different steps. Here is a list of the services I employed:

1. **Amazon S3**: I used Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) to host the static website and store the necessary files.

2. **AWS CloudFront**: To enhance the performance and availability of my website, I leveraged AWS CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN), to distribute the content globally.

3. **Certificate Manager**: To secure my website with HTTPS, I utilized AWS Certificate Manager to manage and deploy SSL/TLS certificates.

4. **AWS Lambda**: For serverless computing, I employed AWS Lambda to run code without the need to provision or manage servers.

5. **DynamoDB**: To store and retrieve data, I utilized DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS.

6. **GitHub Actions**: I integrated GitHub Actions into my workflow for automating tasks, such as building and deploying the application.

7. **Terraform**: I employed Terraform, an infrastructure as code tool, to define and provision my AWS resources in a declarative manner.

By leveraging these services, I was able to build and deploy my Cloud Resume Challenge project in a scalable, secure, and efficient manner.
