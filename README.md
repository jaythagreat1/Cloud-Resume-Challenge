## Cloud Resume Challenge (AWS Track)

Welcome to my Cloud Resume Challenge repository! This challenge is designed for individuals who are interested in kickstarting their career in the cloud. It consists of 16 steps, grouped into 5 different chunks, and offers the flexibility to choose from three major cloud service providers: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Amazon Web Services (AWS). For this particular challenge, I have chosen the AWS track.

To successfully complete the Cloud Resume Challenge (CRC), all 16 steps must be accomplished in their entirety. Here is an overview of the steps involved:

1. Certification
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Static Website
5. HTTPS
6. DNS
7. Javascript
8. Database
9. API
10. Python
11. Tests
12. Infrastructure as Code
